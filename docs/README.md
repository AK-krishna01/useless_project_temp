PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Palli.Biju is a playful web application that converts standard SI measurement units (like meters, kilograms, seconds, etc.) into unique ‚ÄúBiju units‚Äù using predefined conversion factors. Users select a measurement category, enter a value, and instantly see the converted result in Biju units without needing complex input of multiple units.


THE PROBLEM
The world is plagued by the various dimensional unit standards brought upon by the superpower nations.What the world needs now is a common ground,a unified unit standard that crosses borders to unite the entire world.And on this search after hours of research and billions of dollars spent,during one fateful afternoon we finally found our answer.

THE SOLUTION
Palli.Biju is a quirky and interactive unit conversion tool paired with a chatbot inspired by ‚ÄúBiju,‚Äù a house lizard mascot infamous at the College Of Engineering Trivandrum. The software allows users to convert numeric values from standard SI units across various measurement categories (Length, Mass, Area, Volume, Temperature, Speed, Time, Energy, Pressure, Angle, Data Storage, Power) into custom ‚ÄúBiju units‚Äù using predefined totally realistic conversion factors.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Technologies used:-
For Software:
*HTMML
*CSS
*Vanila js

IMPLIMENTATION
Pallli.Biju is built as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a dynamic user interface where measurement categories are displayed as clickable boxes. Upon selecting a category, users can input a numeric value representing the standard SI unit for that category (e.g., meters for length).
The application converts the input value into custom ‚ÄúBiju units‚Äù by multiplying with predefined conversion factors specific to each measurement category. The conversion result is instantly displayed without needing a separate convert button.
Additionally, an integrated chatbot allows users to type queries or prompts. Instead of processing complex AI responses, the chatbot replies with a fun, fixed message (‚Äúzzzzz ü¶é‚Äù) and plays a mascot sound effect.
