## 📜 Project Description

Welcome to **Palli.Biju**, the quirkiest unit converter you’ll ever meet! It transforms boring old SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds… yawn) into *awesome* “Biju units” — a special system dreamed up after hours of intense research (and some coffee). ☕️

Just pick your measurement category, type in your number, and BAM! Instant conversion to Biju units with zero headache and zero need for complicated unit juggling. 🦎✨

## 🧐 The Problem

The world is suffering from the madness of countless unit standards invented by superpowers. It’s chaos out there! 🌍💥

What we need is one universal unit to rule them all — something that unites humanity across borders, cultures, and confused scientists. After spending billions (not really, but it sounds dramatic), we finally cracked the code during one fateful afternoon nap. 🛌💡
