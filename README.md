## 📜 Project Description

Welcome to **Palli.Biju**, the quirkiest unit converter you’ll ever meet! It transforms boring old SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds… yawn) into *awesome* “Biju units” — a special system dreamed up after hours of intense research (and some coffee). ☕️

Just pick your measurement category, type in your number, and BAM! Instant conversion to Biju units with zero headache and zero need for complicated unit juggling. 🦎✨

## 🧐 The Problem

The world is suffering from the madness of countless unit standards invented by superpowers. It’s chaos out there! 🌍💥

What we need is one universal unit to rule them all — something that unites humanity across borders, cultures, and confused scientists. After spending billions (not really, but it sounds dramatic), we finally cracked the code during one fateful afternoon nap. 🛌💡

## 💡 The Solution

**Palli.Biju** is your friendly neighborhood unit converter with a twist: a chatbot inspired by *Biju*, the infamous house lizard mascot of College Of Engineering Trivandrum. 🦎🎉

Convert your numbers from standard SI units into our totally realistic (wink wink) *Biju units* for these categories:

- Length 📏  
- Mass ⚖️  
- Area 🗺️  
- Volume 🥤  
- Temperature 🌡️  
- Speed 🏃‍♂️💨  
- Time ⏰  
- Energy ⚡  
- Pressure 💨  
- Angle 🔄  
- Data Storage 💾  
- Power 🔌

## 🛠️ Technical Details

Built with the classic trio:  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (because who needs frameworks when you have swag?)

## 🚧 Implementation

- Select your measurement category by clicking the shiny boxes.  
- Enter a numeric value in standard SI units (meters, kilograms, whatever).  
- Watch the magic as your number instantly transforms into Biju units — no “Convert” button needed because we live in the future! ✨  
- Feeling chatty? Ask the chatbot anything! Just don’t expect actual AI wisdom — it replies with “zzzzz 🦎” and plays a quirky mascot sound. It’s like your pet lizard, but digital and sassier. 😴🎵
